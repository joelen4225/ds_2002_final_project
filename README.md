# Midterm Project - Player Pitch Performance Analysis
In this repository, you will be able to find all the files necessary to run my Jupyter Notebook. You will notice a SQL file that was used to create tables in my schema, but those tables were not the ones used in the queries I created. The 'dim_' headered tables were loaded into the MySQL schema and then used for queries. You will also see some CSV files were shortened in order to save time. The larger files took really long when uploading to MongoDB Atlas and couldn't be uploaded to GitHub because they went over 25MB. The Jupyter Notebook explains my thought process more thoroughly in regards to the ETL pipeline, but the 'pitch_analysis_data_dump.sql' file explains the dataset I used and how I retrieved that from Kaggle which is important as well, so make sure to check that out. Hope you enjoy my project!
